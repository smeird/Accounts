# Accounts Wiki

Welcome to the Accounts project wiki. Use these pages to learn about the system and how to develop it.

## Pages
- [Setup](Setup.md) - configure the environment and database.
- [Architecture](Architecture.md) - explore how the frontend and backend interact.

## Features
- Import OFX files to record bank transactions.
- Explore dashboards to analyse spending by month or year.
- Tag transactions automatically and suggest budgets with AI.
- Configure tag aliases so different merchant descriptors (for example Tesco and Sainsbury's) map to one canonical tag such as Supermarkets.
- Generate reports and export data in OFX, CSV, or XLSX formats.

# AGENTS Instructions

## Environment
- Target PHP version: 7.0 and above.
- Ensure MySQL is available and configure credentials using the environment variables `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASS`.
- Create database tables with `php php_backend/create_tables.php` and optionally insert a sample account with `php php_backend/public/index.php`.
- Serve the project locally with `php -S localhost:8000` and open `frontend/index.html` in your browser.

## Code Style
- No formal coding standard is enforced; keep code clear and consistent with existing files.
- Use Highcharts for graphs and Tabulator for tables.
- Display monetary values with the pound symbol (Â£).
- Style the frontend with Tailwind CSS. Wrap primary sections in white card components (`bg-white p-6 rounded shadow`).
- Use Font Awesome for interface icons.
- Tabulator tables should apply Tailwind utility classes.
- Provide popover help for form inputs using `data-help` attributes handled by `frontend/js/input_help.js`.
